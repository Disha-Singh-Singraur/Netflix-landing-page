# Netflix Landing Page 🎬

A Netflix-style landing page built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project helped me practice responsive layouts, animations, and a bit of JavaScript interactivity.

## Live Demo : https://disha-singh-singraur.github.io/Netflix-landing-page/

## Features ✨
- Responsive landing page design
- Hero section with background image + dark overlay
- Trending carousel with left/right arrow scrolling
- Hover zoom effect on trending cards
- FAQ accordion with smooth animation
  
## What Was Difficult For Me 😭
- Making everything responsive without breaking the layout  
- Keeping the **huge trending numbers** or **ranks** from pushing the screen sideways  
- Accidentally creating a **horizontal scrollbar** 100 times  
- Arrow buttons that refused to behave  
- CSS making me question all my life choices 😅

But yes… after a lot of fixes, everything finally works.

## Technologies Used 🛠
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How to Run 🚀
